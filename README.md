## Step Three: Setting up Chrome Remote Desktop

This guide will help you set up Chrome Remote Desktop on your Linux system. We'll cover different desktop environments and display managers. Choose the section relevant to your system configuration.

### 1. Update System and Install `wget`

First, update your system's package list and upgrade existing packages. Then, install `wget` which we'll use to download files.

```bash
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install wget -y
````

### 2\. Download and Install Chrome Remote Desktop

Download the Chrome Remote Desktop package and install it using `apt`.

```bash
sudo wget [https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb](https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb)
sudo apt install ./chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb -y
```

### 3\. Install Desktop Environment and Configure Display Manager

Select your desired desktop environment and follow the corresponding instructions:

#### **Option A: GNOME (with GDM3)**

If you are using GNOME with GDM3, use these commands:

1.  **Install GNOME:**

    ```bash
    sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
    apt install --assume-yes gnome gnome-shell ubuntu-desktop dbus-x11
    ```

2.  **Enable GDM3 (if not already enabled):**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable gdm3.service
    ```

3.  **Configure Chrome Remote Desktop for GNOME:**

    ```bash
    sudo bash -c 'echo "exec /usr/bin/gnome-session" > /etc/chrome-remote-desktop-session'

    ```

4.  **Disable the default display manager if its not GDM3:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl disable lightdm.service # If you were using LightDM
    # or
    sudo systemctl disable sddm.service  # If you were using SDDM
    # ... (replace with your previous display manager if different)
    ```

5.  **Enable and Start Chrome Remote Desktop Service:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable chrome-remote-desktop
    sudo systemctl start chrome-remote-desktop
    ```

#### **Option B: XFCE (with LightDM)**

If you are using XFCE with LightDM, use these commands:

1.  **Install XFCE:**

    ```bash
    sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
    apt install --assume-yes xfce4 desktop-base dbus-x11 xscreensaver
    ```

2.  **Configure Chrome Remote Desktop for XFCE:**

    ```bash
    sudo bash -c 'echo "exec /etc/X11/Xsession /usr/bin/xfce4-session" > /etc/chrome-remote-desktop-session'
    ```

3.  **Disable GDM3 (if it was previously enabled):**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl disable gdm3.service
    ```

4.  **Enable LightDM (if not already enabled):**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable lightdm.service
    ```

5.  **Enable and Start Chrome Remote Desktop Service:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable chrome-remote-desktop
    sudo systemctl start chrome-remote-desktop
    ```

#### **Option C: KDE Plasma (with SDDM)**

If you are using KDE Plasma with SDDM, use these commands:

1.  **Install KDE Plasma:**

    ```bash
    sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
    apt install --assume-yes kde-plasma-desktop dbus-x11
    ```

2.  **Enable SDDM (if not already enabled):**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable sddm.service
    ```

3.  **Configure Chrome Remote Desktop for KDE:**
    Create the file `/etc/chrome-remote-desktop-session` and add the following:

    ```
    exec /usr/bin/startplasma-x11
    ```

    To create the file using the terminal:

    ```bash
    echo "exec /usr/bin/startplasma-x11" | sudo tee /etc/chrome-remote-desktop-session
    ```

4.  **Disable the default display manager if it's not SDDM:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl disable lightdm.service # If you were using LightDM
    # or
    sudo systemctl disable gdm3.service  # If you were using GDM3
    # ... (replace with your previous display manager if different)
    ```

5.  **Enable and Start Chrome Remote Desktop Service:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable chrome-remote-desktop
    sudo systemctl start chrome-remote-desktop
    ```

#### **Option D: Other Desktop Environments**

If you are using a different desktop environment, you'll need to:

1.  **Install your desired desktop environment** using `apt`.
2.  **Determine the correct command** to start your desktop environment session. This is usually found in the desktop environment's documentation or configuration files.
3.  **Modify the `/etc/chrome-remote-desktop-session`** file (as shown in the XFCE example) and replace `/usr/bin/xfce4-session` with the correct command for your desktop environment.
4.  **Disable and replace your previous display manager** with the one that's compatible with your chosen desktop environment. This may involve enabling a new display manager and disabling the old one (as shown in previous options).
5.  **Enable and Start Chrome Remote Desktop Service:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable chrome-remote-desktop
    sudo systemctl start chrome-remote-desktop
    ```
